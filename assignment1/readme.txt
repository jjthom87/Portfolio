# Basic-Portfolio

This was my first assignment as part of my Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I spent around 20 hours working on it, with about 10 hours of frustration and another 10 of fun. At first, I spent a lot of time with padding and margins, and was unable to incorporate the float that the professor wanted us to use; However, it came clear to me that it was not too difficult to use it, even though it is still very confusing. I have become very fascinated with everything that can be done with html and css. I had a lot of fun working on the first project. I made sure to take the time to make sure all of the indentations in my html file were in order. My CSS file could’ve been in better order, but that’s okay, as I’m sure that I will be dealing with it much more in the future. Once I got that hang of it and all of the formatting looked good, I had the time to play around and make my site look nice to the eyes. I’m looking forward to learning about Java because I was unable to get the submit button to send straight to my email, but im going to keep using trial and error to make things work. 

If there’s one thing about coding, its just trial, error, and time. Im sacrificing my social life in order to learn, and it’s bothering me less and less as I become more comfortable. I understand that there are going to be a lot of tough times with coding, but I just have to get through it. I have no choice. Im truly excited to see how much I can actually learn. For the record, the homework was due on Saturday, I handed it in Thursday so I can party all of Friday for a friends fiances birthday. It’ll be one of my few times going out during the bootcamp, but I made time for it. Later!
