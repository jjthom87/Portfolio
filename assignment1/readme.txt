#portfolio - Assignment 1

I have been working on margining my website to fit all media devices. Difficult task, as it is my first time doing it. As usual, it was half frustration and half enjoyment. To be honest, i don't mind the process. A little tedious, but im sure i will learn more over time. Something tells me. This wasn't part of the assignment to go the extra, but im in coding mode. I made the first page fit to a point where i was satisfied. I'm dealing with word wrapping my index.html file, it's tough. Going to call it a night and take it on tomorrow.
